Death is drawing near
I know it's true but have no fear
I know I cannot escape my fate
Turns its deadly wheel
Judgement day is closing in
But still I can't feel remorse
Is for the weak
I stand silent while they speak
Their accusations are all lies
Spread by preaching men
I'm on trial for being who I am
And praising the gods of my native land

I will stand firm, I refuse to kneel
The fury in me is divine
My dark grave awaits
My fate is revealed
But I'm not afraid to die
I will stand firm, I refuse to kneel
The fury in me is divine
My dark grave awaits
My fate is revealed
But I'm not afraid to die

Death! The day to die is here
The sun rides high on the northern sphere
And the executioner sharpens his axe
Shines in the sun
I smile when they tie me down
And hear the sound of the falling blade

Death
Sweet death
Relieve me from this world
Death
Sweet death
Relieve me, relieve

So death finally came to him
The pagan man could not be turned
He faced death with a grin
Now his head rests in the dust
The proud man stood firm
He refused to kneel
The fury in him was divine
Now he is dead
His fate has been sealed
He's brought to Golden Hall up high
