[Chorus]
I hear the voices
They sing to me sweetly
Guiding my footsteps
If only you believe
You know this is divine love
I thought that love was over
I thought that it was too late
And just when I was gonna throw it all away
I heard the voices of the angels say
I know how hard your way
I know how much you've tried
I know the struggles you're going through
The father sends to you
Up above
[Chorus]
I was only half alive
When I came to realize
There was someone who'd be there for me
I heard the melodies from heaven ring
I know how hard your way
I know how much you've tried
I know the struggles you're going through
The father sends to you
Up above
[Chorus]
I sing a song
If it makes me feel happy inside
I know the Lord
Showers me comforts me with divine love
[Chorus]
